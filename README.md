# Test the Use of Tables in Pandoc

This probably is a temporary repository that will be deleted once the tests finish.

# Notes

- Output from grid table has a sense of column width (in test 1, multiline too)
- Writing to simple/multiline tables will left aligned even if the HTML source is not (pipe table outputs do not have this problem)
- Only simple and pipe tables do not support multiline
